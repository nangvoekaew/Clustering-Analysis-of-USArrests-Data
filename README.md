## Project Description
This project analyzes the **USArrests** dataset, which contains crime statistics for all 50 U.S. states. The core of the project is a Jupyter Notebook that uses various clustering algorithms to group states with similar crime profiles.

The analysis includes:
- Data loading and initial exploration  
- Data preprocessing to prepare the data for clustering  
- Applying different clustering methods, such as **K-Means** and **Agglomerative Clustering**  
- Visualizing the resulting clusters to identify patterns and insights  

## Files in this Repository
- `Clustering Analysis of USArrests Data.ipynb`: The Jupyter Notebook containing all the Python code for analysis, visualizations, and explanations.  
- `USArrests.csv`: The dataset containing crime statistics for murder, assault, rape, and urban population percentage for each U.S. state.
